import React from "react"

function Profile (props) {
    
    return(
        <div>This page will have all the profile edit part. <br></br> 
        Either combine it with Create Profile or do something to make it work lol. <br></br> 
        Router for this page can be found in Home.js <br></br>
        Also I think we should remove logout from navbar
        </div>
    )

}

export default Profile
